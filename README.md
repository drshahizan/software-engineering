| 6 | [Tools: Draw.io and PlantUML](/materials/uml) | Draw.io is a web-based diagramming tool that allows users to create various types of diagrams, such as flowcharts, network diagrams, and UML diagrams, using a drag-and-drop interface. It offers a wide range of shapes, icons, and formatting options to help users create professional-looking diagrams quickly and easily. On the other hand, PlantUML is a text-based diagramming tool that uses a simple and intuitive language to create UML diagrams, sequence diagrams, and other types of diagrams. PlantUML is ideal for software developers who prefer to write code to create diagrams, rather than using a visual interface. | | |

## Tools
Diagrams are visual representations of information or data that help convey complex concepts, processes or systems in a clear and concise manner. Flowcharts are diagrams that use shapes and arrows to illustrate the steps in a process or algorithm. System architecture diagrams show the structure of a system and its components, illustrating how they interact with each other. There are many tools available for creating diagrams, including web-based applications like Diagrams.net, PlantUML, Mermaid.js, and Vega-Lite, as well as desktop software like yEd Graph Editor and Graphviz. Other tools like Structurizr and C4-PlantUML are designed specifically for creating system architecture diagrams, while Nomnoml and Mermaid.js can create various types of diagrams including UML diagrams and flowcharts.
