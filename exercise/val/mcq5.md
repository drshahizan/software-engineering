# Case Study: Software Verification and Validation

## Background
ABC Solutions is a software development company specializing in e-commerce solutions. They have recently developed an online shopping platform called "ShopEase" to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers. As part of their quality assurance process, ABC Solutions implements software verification and validation techniques to ensure the reliability and functionality of their software.

## Verification
Verification activities at ABC Solutions aim to confirm that the software is built according to its specifications and requirements. They perform code inspections and conduct reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices. Additionally, they use static code analysis tools to identify potential defects, coding errors, and security vulnerabilities. Verification activities help ABC Solutions verify the accuracy of the software design and implementation.

## Validation
Validation activities focus on assessing whether the developed software meets the needs and expectations of the end-users. ABC Solutions conducts usability testing, where real users navigate the ShopEase platform to evaluate its ease of use, intuitiveness, and overall user experience. They gather feedback from users to validate that the software effectively addresses their requirements and ensures customer satisfaction. Validation activities ensure that ShopEase is a user-friendly and customer-centric e-commerce platform.
