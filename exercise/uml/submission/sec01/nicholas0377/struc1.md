**Section:01**

## Answer
1.  The most suitable software process model would be the Agile development model. The Agile model is well-suited for projects with evolving requirements. In the case of Citra's Travel Agency, there may be changes or refinements to the reservation functionality, tours information, or additional features requested by the agency or the clients. Agile allows for flexibility and easy incorporation of changes throughout the development process.
2.  Functional Requirements which is Online Reservation. The system should allow registered clients to make tour reservations online and clients should be able to select their desired tour, specify the number of participants, and provide necessary details for the reservation. Then, Tour Information. The system should provide detailed information about the available tours, including destinations, dates, itineraries, prices, and any additional relevant information and clients should be able to view tour descriptions, highlights, and any special requirements or restrictions associated with each tour. Lastly, Reservation Management. The clerk should have the ability to add, delete, and update client and tour information and should be able to confirm and process tour reservations made by clients. For the Non-Functional Requirements, the first one is Usability. The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and understand and it should provide clear instructions and guidance for clients during the reservation process. Lastly, Security. The system should ensure the privacy and security of client information and implement measures to protect client data during transmission and storage.
