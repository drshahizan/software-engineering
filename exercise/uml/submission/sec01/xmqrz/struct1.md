## Answer

Software Process Model Selection:
The most suitable software process model for developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency is the Agile software development model. The Agile model emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and incremental development, which align well with the dynamic nature of the project requirements and the need for continuous feedback and adjustments.

Justification:

Flexibility: The Agile model allows for changes and iterations throughout the development process, which is essential in a project where requirements may evolve or need clarification. As the Citra Tours & Travel Agency may have evolving business needs and user preferences, the Agile model enables the development team to quickly respond to these changes and incorporate them into the system.

Incremental Development: The Agile model focuses on delivering working software in small increments or iterations. This approach enables the agency to have early access to essential features and functionalities, allowing them to start using and providing feedback on the system at an early stage. This iterative approach ensures that the system meets the client's expectations and provides opportunities for continuous improvement.

Collaboration: The Agile model promotes close collaboration between the development team, the agency's clerk, and the manager. Regular interactions and feedback sessions help ensure that the system aligns with the agency's requirements and business goals. The clerk and the manager can actively participate in the development process, providing insights and clarifications, which leads to a better understanding of the system's functionality.

Functional Requirements:
User Registration: Clients should be able to register themselves on the application by providing necessary details such as name, contact information, and email address.

Tour Reservation: Clients should be able to browse available tours, select a desired tour, specify the number of participants, and make a reservation for the chosen tour.

Reservation Cancellation: Clients should have the ability to cancel their previous tour reservations. The system should update the reservation status and provide appropriate notifications to the client.

Non-Functional Requirements:
Security: The system should ensure secure access and data protection, particularly for client information, login credentials, and payment details.

Performance: The application should be responsive and perform well even during peak usage times. It should handle multiple concurrent users and provide quick response times for search, reservation, and cancellation operations.

Scenario: Make a tour reservation
Pre-conditions:

The client is registered and logged into the system.
The client has searched and selected a desired tour.
Normal Event(s):

The client selects the number of participants for the tour.
The client provides any additional preferences or requirements for the tour.
The client proceeds to the payment section and provides the necessary payment details.
The system validates the payment and confirms the tour reservation.
The system generates an electronic receipt containing payment and tour reservation details.
The receipt is emailed to the client for reference.
Abnormal Event(s):

If the payment validation fails, the client is notified and prompted to provide valid payment details.
Post-conditions:

The client receives a confirmation email with the tour reservation details and payment information.
