Software validation will ensure that the software meets the intended purpose and satisfies the needs of the end-users and stakeholders.
Hence, XYZ Healthcare Solutions are able to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the MediCare software.

Techniques used for verification are unit testing, where individual units of the software, such as functions or modules, are tested in isolation to validate their functionality. Besides, integration testing is performed to assess the interaction and compatibility of different software components, ensuring that they work seamlessly together. Additionally, code reviews and inspections is conducted to detect coding errors, ensure adherence to coding standards, and maintain code quality.

User acceptance testing will gather users' feedbacks to help in identify any gaps or areas for improvement and ensures that MediCare provides a reliable and user-friendly patient management solution. As a result, MediCare software meets the intended purpose and satisfies the needs of the end-users and stakeholders.
