!. Agile Model. Becasue agile model is known  for its flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements. In the travel industry, customer preferences and market trends can evolve rapidly. By adopting an Agile approach, the development team can quickly respond to changes and incorporate them into the system, ensuring that the online tour reservation system stays up-to-date and competitive.

2. Functional Requirements:

User Registration. The system should allow users to create an account by providing necessary details such as name, contact information, and login credentials. Reservation Cancellation. Clients should have the ability to cancel their previously made tour reservations through the system.

Non-Functional Requirements:

Security. The system should ensure secure storage and transmission of sensitive user information, such as login credentials and payment details. Performance. The system should be responsive and able to handle a large number of concurrent users, ensuring quick loading times and efficient processing of reservation requests.
