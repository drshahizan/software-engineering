   Next, this model is very suitable for a travel application that relies heavily on user satisfaction as it is a customer-centric approach. The system will definitely be able to meet the user's expectations as the clients will be involved throughout the development process.
   Lastly, this software process model uses iterative and incremental development which makes it easier to incorporate changes.
