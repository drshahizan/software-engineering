- [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
  
### 1. Executive Summary
- Start the proposal with a brief summary that highlights the main points of the project, including its goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.

### 2. Background:
- The introduction should provide background information about the software project and the purpose of the proposal. 
- It should also briefly describe the problem the software is meant to solve, the benefits it will provide, and its potential impact on the organization.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

Objective 1: Improve the quality of education
One of the primary objectives of implementing a student feedback system in University Technology Malaysia (UTM) is to improve the quality of education. The feedback provided by students can help the faculty and administration identify areas where improvements can be made. This, in turn, can lead to better teaching methods, course materials, and assessments.

Objective 2: Enhance student engagement
A student feedback system can also help to enhance student engagement in the learning process. When students feel that their feedback is being heard and taken seriously, they are more likely to feel invested in their education. This can lead to increased motivation and better academic outcomes.

Objective 3: Provide a platform for continuous improvement
A student feedback system can also serve as a platform for continuous improvement. By collecting feedback regularly, UTM can identify trends and make adjustments as needed. This can help to ensure that the university is meeting the needs of its students and providing the best possible educational experience.

Objective 4: Foster transparency and communication
Implementing a student feedback system can also foster transparency and communication between students, faculty, and administration. When students have a platform to voice their concerns and suggestions, it can help to build trust and improve the overall culture of the university.

Objective 5: Support accreditation and compliance efforts
Finally, implementing a student feedback system can support UTM's efforts to maintain accreditation and compliance with relevant regulations. Many accrediting bodies require universities to collect and use student feedback to inform decision-making and improve educational outcomes. A robust student feedback system can help UTM meet these requirements and maintain its status as a top-tier institution.

### 4. Scope: 
- The scope section defines the boundaries of the project and outlines what features and functionality will be included in the software. 
- It should also describe any limitations or constraints that may affect the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
- The budget section should outline the costs associated with the development of the software, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. It should also include any contingency plans for unexpected expenses.

### 7. System Architecture:
- Provide a detailed overview of the proposed system architecture including the tools and technologies that will be used to develop and deploy the system
- Explain how the data will be stored, managed, and analyzed, as well as the hardware and software requirements needed to support the system.
- Discuss the tools and frameworks that will be used for data visualization and analysis.
- Provide a flowchart or block diagram of the system architecture.

The proposed system architecture for a student feedback system in University Technology Malaysia (UTM) can be designed as follows:

Front-end Interface:
The front-end interface will be the part of the system that the students will interact with. It will be a user-friendly interface that allows students to provide feedback on various aspects of their learning experience, including instructors, courses, and facilities. The interface will be accessible through a web-based platform, making it easy for students to provide feedback from anywhere, at any time.

Back-end Server:
The back-end server will be responsible for storing and processing the feedback data collected from students. It will be designed to handle large volumes of data and provide secure storage and retrieval of data. The server will use a database management system to manage and store the feedback data collected.

Data Processing and Analysis Module:
The data processing and analysis module will be responsible for analyzing the feedback data collected from students. It will use data analysis techniques such as sentiment analysis, clustering, and visualization to identify patterns and trends in the feedback data. This module will help the university administration to make informed decisions about improving the quality of education and student experience.

Reporting Module:
The reporting module will be responsible for generating reports based on the feedback data collected. These reports will be designed to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the educational system at UTM, as well as the needs and preferences of the students. These reports can be used by the faculty and administration to make data-driven decisions to improve the quality of education and the student experience.

Authentication and Security Module:
The authentication and security module will be responsible for ensuring that only authorized users can access the system. It will use secure authentication protocols and data encryption techniques to protect the sensitive information collected from students. This module will ensure that the feedback system is secure, confidential, and compliant with data privacy regulations.

Integration Module:
The integration module will allow for the integration of the feedback system with other systems and applications used at UTM, such as the Learning Management System (LMS). This will enable the system to access relevant student data and provide a more comprehensive analysis of the feedback data collected. The integration module will also enable the system to send alerts and notifications to relevant stakeholders, such as instructors and administrators, based on the feedback data collected.

Overall, the proposed system architecture will be designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, enabling the university to collect and analyze feedback data from students to improve the quality of education and the student experience at UTM.
