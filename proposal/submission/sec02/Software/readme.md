### 1. Executive Summary
The Student Health and Wellness website is an esteemed software engineering course project that Pusat Kesihatan University (PKU) proudly endorses. Aimed at assisting students in their university lives, this website will offer a plethora of resources and tools to assist students in taking care of their physical, mental, and emotional health. With a combination of longer or more complex sentences alongside concise and short ones, the website provides a way to optimally manage one's wellbeing. For university students, this website promises to revolutionise the way they manage their health by providing them with the ability to regulate and nourish their bodies, minds, and souls. However, for this Student Health and Wellness System project, it seems that this is the first implementation of this system, and it will only include student Kolej Tun Dr. Ismail (KTDI) as our sample user that is included in this system.

This web based system aims to provide an easy-to-use experience, with the latest software engineering techniques employed to deliver an intuitive interface. Accessibility is key, and with the website being compatible across desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, no matter the device, all students can enjoy utilising the site.

The Student Health and Wellness system will be packed with an array of engaging resources for students to access. Articles, videos, and podcasts varying in topics from nutrition to mental health will be featured and developed in collaboration with PKU, assuring the accuracy, timeliness, and appropriateness of the content. These resources offer university students the knowledge to maintain a healthy and wholesome lifestyle.

In a nutshell, the revolutionary Student Health and Wellness website is an active platform with immense potential to significantly improve university student lives. Through the provision of accurate sources and data, as well as the offering of resources and services to aid them in maintaining their physical and mental health, this website will assist students in achieving all they can while leading a content and healthy existence. With the help of interrogating perplexity and burstiness, the effects of this initiative could be revolutionary.

### 2. Background:
Navigating the complex and slow process of seeking medical attention for university students can be a daunting task. Some students have to travel long distances to the Pusat Kesihatan University to use the current walk-in system, resulting in long waiting times and inefficient use of time. To simplify these difficulties, Student Health and Wellness is a project designed to help students receive medical attention more quickly and easily.

To streamline this process and increase efficiency, a new website will be implemented to enable students to pre-book their appointments and take advantage of online consultations with medical professionals. This is sure to save time, while providing a secure and convenient platform to access medical care. The website will also simplify appointment management, ensuring students make the most of their time, and alleviating any lengthy wait times.

The Student Health and Wellness website will not only offer invaluable health-related information to students, but will also strive to improve upon the healthcare experience of university goers by emphasizing on increased health awareness, and ultimately, fostering a healthier overall campus atmosphere. By giving students the necessary tools for maintaining a sound physical and psychological well-being, the website is poised to revolutionize the healthcare landscape for students, and beyond.

### 3. Objectives:
- To improve the overall wellbeing of university students by using an innovative strategy to provide direct access to medical resources, introduce personalized health tracking tools and offer reliable health tips and advice. 

(Example：The proposed system will reduce the PKU processing for time by 25%, resulting in a 25% reduction in administrative workload.)

- To provide students with a platform to communicate and interact with medical professionals at the PKU facility, gain medical advice, and schedule appointments for medical services.

(Example：Revolutionizing healthcare delivery is the intended outcome of the proposed system, resulting in a 30% increase in online consultations and a 15% decrease in workload. The goal of the changes is to attract fewer walk-in patients, lowering their percentage by 30%. This innovative approach utilizes complex wording and sentence construction to streamline medical services.)

- To provide a swift and easy way to get an immediate avenue for help in times of crisis to students by calling PKU for emergency assistance.

(Example: At a 30% improvement rate, the PKU emergency assistance system will become much more efficient due to the proposed emergency button. Overall, the university's emergency health issues will also see a 30% reduction.)

- To enable PKU to better understand the health needs of the student population and provide targeted interventions through the collection and analysis of data inside the system..

(Example: This will increase the efficiency of diagnosing health needs and infections among students by 20% and increase the healthcare service to students by 25%.)


### 4. Scope: 
The project proposal focuses exclusively on developing a software application to manage student health and wellness. Our primary objective is to design, implement, and maintain this system while avoiding hardware or infrastructure upgrades, as well as changes in existing policies or procedures.
  
Defined by the following will be the boundaries of the project:
- Seamlessly integrating with the current student information system, the Student Health and Wellness Management System is set to be crafted by a development team that will make sure it's compatible with the administrators' goals. Close cooperation will ensure a compatibility that won't become a hassle.
- Out of scope and further analysis will be required for any additional features requested by stakeholders of the proposed system. In terms of student health and wellness, only health tracking, online chat with PKU, SOS, making appointments, and health tips will be included.
- Including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), all applicable laws and regulations will be followed by the security and privacy features of the system.
  
In final analysis, the proposed Student Health and Wellness System is a broad, but controlled program requiring strict adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and policies. Moreover, intricate and diverse processing must be applied to guarantee maximum efficiency. This necessitates a delicate balance between elaborate, detailed sentences and much simpler, straightforward ones. Ultimately, this strenuous undertaking assures the creation of an effective Student Health and Wellness System.

### 8. Risks Assessment:
In general, every project can be influenced by a risk so they required a special assessment procedure of the potential risks that could lead to the project's failure or loss if they occur. To develop a student health and wellness management system, the possible risks are: 
1. Data breaches: The website may contain sensitive information, such as student health records, which could be targeted by hackers. This could result in the theft of personal information and medical histories, leading to identity theft and other forms of fraud.

2. Denial of service(DoS) attacks: A malicious user or group may attempt to overload the website with traffic, causing it to crash or become inaccessible. This could disrupt the availability of critical health services and information.

3. Malware infections: The website may be infected with malware, which could spread to users' computers and compromise their security. This could result in the theft of personal information or control of the user's device.

4. Insecure coding practices: If the website is not developed using secure coding practices, vulnerabilities could be introduced into the code that could be exploited by attackers.

5. Insider threats: Employees or contractors with access to the website's systems may intentionally or accidentally cause security breaches or data leaks.

To mitigate these risks, a few steps can be taken: 
1. Implement Robust Security Measures: This include the use of SSL certificates, two-factor authentication, encryption and frequent website security updates. It is crucial to constantly evaluate the website's security to find any weaknesses.

2. Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF): A WAF can assist in removing harmful traffic from a network before it reaches a server. It can identify and prevent requests intended to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, such as SYN and ICMP floods.

3. Update software and plugin: It is crucial to keep software and plugins used by the website up-to-date, including the operating system, web server software, content management system and any third-party plugins because malware can take advantage of weaknesses created by outdated software. 

4. Follow secure coding guidelines: To make sure that the website is designed with secure coding practises in mind, follow known secure coding guidelines such as the OWASP Top Ten or CERT Secure Coding Standards. These guidelines should cover aspects like input validation, authentication, access control, and data encryption.

5. Implement strict access controls: It is important to set up strict access restrictions and allow only those people who truly require access to sensitive information to perform their jobs. Access control lists, role-based access controls, and user authentication can help with this.
