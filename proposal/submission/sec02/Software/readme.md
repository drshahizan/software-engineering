### 1. Executive Summary
The Student Health and Wellness System is an esteemed software engineering course project with the cooperation of Pusat Kesihatan Universiti (PKU). Aimed at assisting students in their university lives, this mobile application will offer a plethora of resources and tools to assist students in taking care of their physical, mental, and emotional health. However, for this Student Health and Wellness System project, it seems that this is the first implementation of this system, and it will only include student Kolej Tun Dr. Ismail (KTDI) as our sample user that is included in this system. Key features of this mobile application system include personal health information, mental health testing, patient queue status and wait time, emergency calls, health tips, and announcements. The revolutionary student health and wellness system is an active platform with immense potential to significantly improve the lives of university students. By providing accurate sources and data, as well as offering resources and services to help them maintain their physical and mental health, this system will help students achieve all they can while living a happy and healthy life.

---

### 2. Background:
Seeking medical attention as a university student can be overwhelming, given the complex and cumbersome process. Unfortunately, some students have to travel long distances just to reach Pusat Kesihatan Universiti for medical services. This results in prolonged wait times and ineffective utilisation of time. Fortunately, the Student Health and Wellness Project is designed to simplify this ordeal and enable quick access to medical care for students in need.

This Student Health and Wellness system is used to increase efficiency and productivity at PKU which lacks staff. Through this particular system, students at this university can determine the wait time and waiting people for each medical department from time to time at PKU and have online consultations for minor health issues with medical officers when they are free in between 24 hours. In fact, this will decrease the time spent by students waiting for their consultation and offer a more reliable and accessible spot for students to acquire medical care. Nonetheless, this system also operates as a data storage where users can store their medical files, boosting productivity for future diagnoses.

The Student Health and Wellness System will not only offer invaluable health-related information to students but will also strive to improve the healthcare experience of university goers by emphasising increased health awareness and ultimately fostering a healthier overall campus atmosphere. By giving students the necessary tools for maintaining sound physical and psychological well-being, the system is poised to revolutionise the healthcare landscape for students and beyond.

---

### 3. Objectives:
- To improve the overall wellbeing of university students by using an innovative strategy to provide direct access to medical resources, introduce personalised health tracking tools, and offer reliable health tips and advice.

> Example: The proposed system will reduce the PKU processing time by 25%, resulting in a 25% reduction in administrative workload.

- To provide students with a platform to communicate and interact with medical professionals at the PKU facility, gain medical advice, and schedule appointments for medical services.

> Example: Revolutionising healthcare delivery is the intended outcome of the proposed system, resulting in a 30% increase in online consultations and a 15% decrease in workload. The goal of the changes is to attract fewer walk-in patients, lowering their percentage by 30%. This innovative approach utilises complex wording and sentence construction to streamline medical services.

- To provide a swift and easy way to get an immediate avenue for help in times of crisis to students by calling PKU for emergency assistance.

> Example: At a 30% improvement rate, the PKU emergency assistance system will become much more efficient due to the proposed emergency button. Overall, the university's emergency health issues will also see a 30% reduction.

- To enable PKU to better understand the health needs of the student population and provide targeted interventions through the collection and analysis of data inside the system.

> Example: This will increase the efficiency of diagnosing health needs and infections among students by 20% and increase the healthcare service to students by 25%.

### 4. Scope: 
The project proposal focuses exclusively on developing a software application to manage student health and wellness. Our primary objective is to design, implement, and maintain this system while avoiding hardware or infrastructure upgrades, as well as changes in existing policies or procedures.

The following will be the boundaries of the project:

- Seamlessly integrating with the current student information system, the Student Health and Wellness Management System is set to be crafted by a development team that will make sure it's compatible with the administrators' goals. Close cooperation will ensure compatibility that won't become a hassle.
- Out of scope and further analysis will be required for any additional features requested by stakeholders of the proposed system. In terms of student health and wellness, only online consultation with PKU, SOS, medical lab results,mental health tests, patient pending and waiting times, announcements, and health tips will be included.
- Including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), all applicable laws and regulations will be followed by the security and privacy features of the system.

For this system, it will include the features below:
- Personal health information which includes demographic information and lab results (eg. blood test, urine test, X-ray result)
- Mental health self-test (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)) that will help evaluate the patient's reaction to treatment.
- Patient queue status which shows amount of pending patients and estimated waiting time for patients
- SOS button for emergency calls.
- Health tips and healthcare infographics for students.
- Announcement of PKU for any activities held.

In final analysis, the proposed Student Health and Wellness System is a broad, but controlled program requiring strict adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and policies. Moreover, intricate and diverse processing must be applied to guarantee maximum efficiency. This necessitates a delicate balance between elaborate, detailed sentences and much simpler, straightforward ones. Ultimately, this strenuous undertaking assures the creation of an effective Student Health and Wellness System.
