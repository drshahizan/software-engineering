### 2. Background:
Badal Hajj is the act of performing Hajj for other people that cannot do Hajj on their own in under some circumstances. The time for doing the Badal Hajj is as same as Hajj which is once a year unlike doing Umrah. However, the current manual system which 80% handled by human can be cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone. The process is characterized by long waiting, paper-based form, use Whatsaap to send and get the information and human error likely to be occur due to managing bulk data. This manual system often reuslt in delays, errors and frustration for both company and client, leading to a neagtive impact on the overall company's name.

Our proposed Badal hajj and Umrah Management System aims to address these challenges by introducing a modern, intuitive and automated sytem that streamlines the workflow. The proposed system leverages the latest technologies and best practices to deliver a seamless user experience for the company and client.  Key features of this system include real-time processed document, automatic data handling and management and real-time payment. The management, they can easiy monitor and handle bulk data without losing or overlooked the client information.

The proposed Badal Hajj and Umrah Management System has the potential to significantly improve overall workflow experience for the company and client. By reducing the management burden of manual processes, the proposed system will save time, reduce errors and increased the client satisfaction. Additionally, the system will provide valuable help to manage all the data that have been received by the client. Overall, the proposed system has the potential to smooth out and simplify the workflow thus can increase the company management efficiency.

### 3. Objectives:
Our proposed Badal Hajj and Umrah Management System aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. Improve efficiency and reduce management burden: The system aims to reduce the time and resources required for manual processes by automating the process. The objective is to streamline the registration process, reduce administrative workload, and reduce human error in managing client information
>**Example**: The manual process of getting information 50% by using Whatsaap and 50% by walk in. The proposed system will reduced the usage of Whatsaap and walk in by 10%-15%.

2. Enhance client experience and engagement: The system aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easier for client to register and send tehir the information to the company without going to the comaony. The objective is to improve the overall client experience, increase engagement, and promote ease for the client.
>**Example**: The proposed system will increase client satisfaction with the process by 30%, resulting in a 10% increase in client user experience.

3. Improve bulk data managing: The system aims to provide bulk data managing and increase efficiency during data management. The objective is to decrease human error such as forgetting the info or confusion and avoid the management from overlook the data..
>**Example**: The proposed system will improve bulk data managing while decreasing human error during managing all of the client info.

Overall, these SMART objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. They align with the goals and objectives of the project and provide a clear roadmap for achieving the desired outcomes.

### 4. Scope: 
The system will allow user to create an account and and make the registration for the hajj or umrah ,user will fill in the important information such as full name, age, address, contact number and more. This system also will be included the section for health information to know the applicants health status for the screening process by those responsible managing the registrations.Some limitations for this project is the security part which the system need to be achieve a certain security stndard to protect those informations and prevent from any breach or unauthorized access.Other than that, the project need to be completed on time or it will affect the success of the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
1. Planning: In the planning phase, the project team will define the project scope, goals, and objectives. This will include identifying the features and functionalities required for the system, and prioritizing them based on their importance to end-users. The team will also define the project timeline and identify the resources required to execute the project.

2. Requirements Gathering: In the requirements gathering phase, the team will work closely with stakeholders to identify the system requirements. This will involve gathering input from end-users, stakeholders, and subject matter experts to ensure that the system meets the needs of all stakeholders. The requirements will be documented and prioritized based on their importance and feasibility.

3. Design: In the design phase, the team will create a design for the system. This will include creating wireframes, prototypes, and mockups to visualize the system's layout and user interface. The design will be reviewed and refined based on feedback from stakeholders and end-users.

4. Implementation: In the implementation phase, the team will begin developing the system. The development work will be divided into sprints, each lasting 2-4 weeks. During each sprint, the team will work on a specific set of features and functionalities. At the end of each sprint, the team will conduct a sprint review and demo the new features to stakeholders and end-users.

5. Testing: In the testing phase, the team will conduct extensive testing to ensure that the system meets the requirements and works as intended. This will include unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. The testing will be conducted throughout the development process, with each sprint being followed by a testing phase.

6. Deployment: In the deployment phase, the team will deploy the system to a production environment. This will involve installing and configuring the system and ensuring that it is ready for end-users. The team will also provide training to end-users to ensure that they know how to use the system.

7. Maintenance: In the maintenance phase, the team will provide ongoing support for the system. This will involve monitoring the system for bugs and issues and addressing them as they arise. The team will also provide updates and enhancements to the system as needed to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of stakeholders and end-users.

Using the Agile model for the software process model of the Badal Hajj and Umrah Management System project will allow the team to work in an iterative and collaborative manner, with a focus on delivering value to end-users at every stage of the development process.

### 6. Budget:
Budget is the important requirement that need to be plan at the early stage so that the project can be proceed without being delayed because the short of budget, there are a few things that need to be pointed out in the budget lists: 

Hardware : RM 100

Software : RM 100

Personnel : RM 100

Testing : RM 100

Back-up funds: RM 400


### 7. System Architecture:

- Explain how the data will be stored, managed, and analyzed, as well as the hardware and software requirements needed to support the system.
- Discuss the tools and frameworks that will be used for data visualization and analysis.
- Provide a flowchart or block diagram of the system architecture.

### 8. Risks Assessment:
Many types of risks may happen during or after the system being develop or done, one of it is technical risks such as data loss, that can happen if the sytem crash or the program crash during the developing time. Another risk is resourse risk such as insufficient resources to continue the project that might cause a delay to the development process and might not achieve the date line being set. Requirement risk is one of risk that could during the project process as the requirements of the projects might change after a few discussion that lead to reconstruct a new developing path as we need to change or adding a few requirements, misunderstanding in requirements being discussed also could cause a problem as the system will be develop another way and lead to error in system's development.

Here is the list of the risks being discussed :

1. Technical risk : 
- Data loss
- System crash

2. Resource risk :
- Short of resource

3. Requirement risk :
- Misscomunication
- Requirement changing or adding

We could prevent this risk from happening by :-

1. Conduct regular testing with the system that has been existing so that we could identify any issue from time to time

2. Backup data and make a recovery plan to avoid any data loss or system crash during or after development process

3. Develop a plan realistically to imagine the resources needed and make it available

4. Clear communication between developers is a need and always inform the stakeholder the project requirements so that the stakeholder is aware of the ongoing project.

5. Develop an emergency plan to deal with the requirements issue as the problems might occur and the developing process will not be delay.
