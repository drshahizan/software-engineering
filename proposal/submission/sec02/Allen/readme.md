### 5. Software Process Model:
The goal of a software process model is to provide a framework for software development that ensures the project is completed within the allocated budget, schedule, and quality standards. The software process model defines the set of activities that must be performed during the software development lifecycle.

For the KTDI MINIMARKET ONLINE SYSTEM, the ideal software process model is the Agile software development process. The justification for this choice is that the Agile methodology emphasizes the iterative and incremental development of software, which is particularly well-suited for complex projects with evolving requirements. In addition, Agile methodology allows for rapid prototyping and customer feedback, which is essential in developing a mini mart online system.

The Agile software development process involves the following phases:

- Planning: The team defines the project scope, objectives, and requirements. Deliverables in this phase include project charters, requirements documents, and a product backlog.
- Design: The team creates the initial design of the system, including wireframes, user interface designs, and architecture diagrams. Deliverables in this phase include design documents, user stories, and user acceptance criteria.
Implementation: The team develops the system incrementally, delivering working software in short sprints. Deliverables in this phase include working software, user acceptance testing reports, and source code.
- Testing: The team performs functional and acceptance testing on the developed software to ensure that it meets the requirements and user acceptance criteria. Deliverables in this phase include test plans, test cases, and defect reports.
Deployment: The team deploys the software to a production environment, ensuring that it is stable and secure. Deliverables in this phase include deployment plans, user guides, and release notes.
- Maintenance: The team provides ongoing support and maintenance of the software, addressing defects and adding new features as needed. Deliverables in this phase include maintenance logs, bug reports, and feature requests.
<br></br>Testing methodologies that would be relevant to the Agile process model include automated testing, exploratory testing, and user acceptance testing. Project management practices that would be relevant include continuous integration, daily stand-up meetings, and sprint planning. Quality assurance processes would involve code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration.



A Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool can be used to help plan and track progress throughout the development process. This will help to ensure that the project stays on schedule and that all tasks are completed as planned.
