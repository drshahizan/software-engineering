# Guide: Intro to Behance

## Description
Behance, part of Adobe, is the leading online platform to showcase & discover creative work. Creative people around the world join Behance, entering a community made with their original work and creative process in mind.

Behance.net is an online platform and social media network that focuses on showcasing and discovering creative work in various fields, including graphic design, illustration, photography, architecture, fashion, and more. It was launched in 2006 by Scott Belsky and Matias Corea and has since become one of the leading platforms for creative professionals to showcase their portfolios and connect with other like-minded individuals.

The primary purpose of Behance is to provide a space for creatives to exhibit their work, gain exposure, and attract potential clients or job opportunities. Users can create individual profiles and upload their projects, which can consist of images, videos, interactive media, and written descriptions. Each project is displayed in a visually appealing and organized manner, allowing visitors to browse through portfolios, appreciate the artwork, and leave comments or appreciations.

One of the notable features of Behance is the "Work in Progress" section, where artists can share their ongoing projects, receive feedback, and document their creative process. This interactive element fosters collaboration and engagement among the Behance community.

Behance also serves as a networking platform, enabling users to follow and connect with other creatives, including designers, artists, photographers, and agencies. This connection-building aspect helps individuals to expand their professional network, seek inspiration, and explore collaborations.

Additionally, Behance provides tools and features for employers and recruiters to discover talented individuals. Companies can search for specific skills or browse portfolios to find suitable candidates for job openings or freelance projects.

In recent years, Behance has introduced curated galleries, featuring outstanding projects and collections across various disciplines. These galleries highlight exceptional work, trends, and emerging talents, providing exposure and recognition to creators.

Behance.net has become a popular platform for both established professionals and aspiring artists, serving as a hub for creative inspiration, collaboration, and professional growth. It has a vast and diverse community of creatives from around the world, making it an invaluable resource for anyone interested in exploring and appreciating the world of design and visual arts.

## Projects
A [Project](https://help.behance.net/hc/en-us/articles/204483644-What-is-a-Project-) is a grouping of images, videos, and other digital content with a related theme or process. Every project has a unique URL that can be shared across the web, as well as a View and Appreciation counter so you can track how many people have seen your project and given you kudos on a job well done. Here is an [example of a Project](https://www.behance.net/gallery/60441657/Behance-Year-in-Review-2017-Our-10-Year-Anniversary) created by the Behance Design Team.

## Following Profiles
Behance members can **Follow** your profile and you can, in turn, follow other users. When you Follow someone, their updates (projects they’ve uploaded, Appreciated, or Added to a Moodboard) appear in your **For You** feed.

## For You Feed
The [For You](https://help.behance.net/hc/en-us/articles/204484454-What-is-the-For-You-feed-) feed is the home screen for signed-in Behance creatives. As you follow more profiles, you'll start to see more projects appear in your feed. To view a Project that appears in your For You feed, simply click the Project Cover and the full contents of the project will open for you to view.

   - Design Screens: Use Figma's design tools to create the individual screens and interfaces for your system. This includes designing buttons, forms, menus, and any other interactive elements.
   - Link Screens: Connect the screens together using Figma's prototyping features. Define the interactions and transitions between screens to create a seamless user experience.
   - Add Interactions: Utilize Figma's interactive features to add interactions such as button clicks, dropdown selections, and navigation flows. This helps simulate the functionality of the system.
   - Test and Refine: Continuously test your prototype within Figma to ensure the interactions and user flows work as intended. Make necessary refinements to improve the overall user experience.

2. **Preparing the Prototype for Behance:**
   - Export Screens: Once your prototype is complete and tested, export each screen as individual images or use Figma's export features to generate assets.
   - Prepare a Presentation: Create a visually appealing presentation to showcase your system development prototype. You can use presentation tools like Figma itself, PowerPoint, or any design software of your choice.
   - Include Descriptions: Write clear and concise descriptions for each screen, explaining the purpose and functionality of the elements and interactions. Add markdown formatting to enhance readability.
