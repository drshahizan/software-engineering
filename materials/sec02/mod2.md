## What is software process❓

Software processes are the **activities for designing, implementing, and testing a software system.**

## Software development lifecycle (SDLC)

A step-by-step process bringing a product’s concept from the ideation stage to implementation and eventually to the market.

## Plan-driven process VS Agile process

   |     Plan-driven process      |            Agile process            |
   | :--------------------------: | :---------------------------------: |
   |      Is always planned       |      Can accommodate  changes       |
   |    For stable development    |       For dynamic development       |
   | Rely on standardized process | Rely on people and their creativity |
   |  Suitable for large systems  |     Suitable for small systems      |
   |     eg. Waterfall Model      |           eg. Scrum Model           |

 <u>*It is best to include both approaches in practical processes.*</u>

## What is a software process model❓

A software process model describes the **sequence** in which the phases of the software lifecycle will be performed.

## Waterfall Model 
- The **first** model to be introduced <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d8/23/11/d8231172c129ef4e296f212d9aa1efa4.gif" alt="Pin on Aniamtion Gif" width="17" />
- A linear and **sequential** approach to [SDLC](#software-development-lifecycle-sdlc)
- Each phase is carried out **completely** before proceeding to the next phase.

## Incremental Model
- Known as **multi-waterfall cycle**
- Each increment passes through the requirements, design, coding and testing phases.
- Functionality developed in each stage will be **added** on the previously developed functionality and this repeats until the software is **fully developed**. 
 
 <p align="center"><img src="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/guide/software-development-process/what-is-a-software-process-model/sites/7/2019/12/incremental-model.png" width="650"/></p>

## Spiral Model   
- A **risk-driven** model [(refer here)](https://www.google.com/search?q=risk-driven+model&source=lmns&bih=745&biw=1536&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiv_rOx9__9AhXw1HMBHUAcCZwQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA)
- Each loop of the spiral is called a **phase of the software development process**
- The exact number of loops **varies** from project to project.<img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BoringShadyBluemorphobutterfly-max-1mb.gif" width="20" />
- During each iteration, the system is explored at **greater depth** and more details are added.

## Comparison of Various Models

| Properties                 | Waterfall Model | Incremental Model | Spiral Model |
| :------------------------- | :-------------: | :---------------: | :----------: |
| Planning early             |        ✓        |         ✓         |      ✓       |
| Returning to earlier phase |                 |         ✓         |      ✓       |
| Large project              |                 |                  |      ✓       |
| Low cost                   |        ✓        |         ✓         |              |
| Flexibility to change      |                 |         ✓         |      ✓       |
| User involvement           |       Low       |   Intermediate    |     High     |
| Risk involvement           |      High       |        Low        |    Medium    |
| Time-frame                 |    Very long    |       Long        |     Long     |

## Reuse-oriented Model
-  Based on the **existence** of a significant number of **reusable components**
-  Focuses on **integrating** these components into a system
<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128159572/228398709-573f5a4c-5629-4826-b427-d2ae54a80be5.png" width="400"/></p>

## The Rational Unified Process (RUP)
-  Known as the **Unified Process Model**
-  An **iterative and incremental** software development process that emphasizes **collaboration** between stakeholders, including customers, developers, and testers, throughout the development lifecycle
-  Can be **time-consuming and resource-intensive**, and may not be appropriate for **small or simple software** development projects

##  Software Prototyping

Software prototyping is an **iterative** and **collaborative** process that helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs of its users and stakeholders.

##  Benefits of Prototyping

| Benefit                   | Waterfall Model |
| :-------------------------| :-------------: |
| Early feedback            | Prototyping allows for early user feedback, helping to identify                                 issues and areas for improvement before development is complete.| 
| Reduced risk              | By identifying potential issues early on, prototyping can reduce                                 the risk of costly mistakes or missteps in the final product.|     
| Faster development        | Prototyping can speed up the development process by identifying                                 potential issues early on and allowing for faster iterations and                                 improvements.| 
| Improved collaboration    | Prototyping can improve collaboration between developers,                                       designers, and stakeholders by providing a tangible, visual                                     representation of the product. |
| Improved user experience  | Prototyping allows for testing and refining of the user                                         experience, leading to a more intuitive and user-friendly final                                 product. |
| Cost savings              | By identifying potential issues early on, prototyping can help to                               reduce the cost of making changes or fixing problems later in the                               development process. |   


## Process of Prototype Development

## Throw-Away Prototypes

A throw-away prototype is a quickly created software prototype that is **not intended for use** in the final product. It is used to **test** and **refine the design**, **gather feedback**, and **identify potential issue**s before moving on to more detailed development. It is **discarded** once its purpose is served
   
The main idea of a throw away prototype is to quickly create a rough version of a product or design idea to test and refine it before spending a lot of time and resources on developing it further. It's like making a rough draft before writing a final version. The throw away prototype is not meant to be the final product, but rather a tool for exploring and improving ideas. Once it has served its purpose, it is discarded or recycled. This approach allows for faster experimentation and iteration with fewer constraints.
