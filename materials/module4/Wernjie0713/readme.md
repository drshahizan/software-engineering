# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Feedback System UTM

<h2>Introduction:</h2> Start with an introduction to the topic of student feedback in universities. Explain why it's important, what the current situation is like, and why there is a need for a new or improved system.

<h2>Objectives:</h2> Clearly state the objectives of your proposed feedback system. What do you hope to achieve? What problems do you want to solve? What benefits will the system provide for students, teachers, and the university as a whole?

<h2>System design:</h2> Describe the design of your proposed feedback system. This could include the format of the feedback, the questions you want to ask, the platform you want to use, the frequency of the feedback, and so on. Be as detailed as possible.

<h2>Benefits:</h2> Explain the benefits of your proposed feedback system. These could include improved student engagement, better student-teacher communication, more effective teaching, and improved academic outcomes. You could also discuss how the feedback system will help the university in terms of institutional effectiveness, quality assurance, and accreditation.

<h2>Implementation plan:</h2> Outline the steps that will be required to implement the feedback system. This could include obtaining approval from university administrators, piloting the system with a small group of students and teachers, refining the system based on feedback, and rolling it out to the wider university community.

<h2>Evaluation:</h2> Explain how you will evaluate the success of the feedback system. What metrics will you use to measure the effectiveness of the system? How will you ensure that the feedback is being used to make positive changes in the university?

<h2>Conclusion:</h2> Sum up your proposal and restate the importance of having a student feedback system in universities. Emphasize the benefits and potential positive impact that the system could have on students, teachers, and the university as a whole.

<h2>Requirement Engineering Process</h2>
<b>1.Requirements Elicitation:</b> The process of gathering and discovering requirements from stakeholders. This can be done through interviews, surveys, workshops, focus groups, and other techniques.
<br><br>
<b>2.Requirements Analysis:</b> Analyzing the requirements to understand their scope, feasibility, and impact. This includes identifying stakeholders, prioritizing requirements, and resolving any conflicts.
<br><br>
<b>3.Requirements Specification:</b> Documenting the requirements in a clear and concise manner. This includes creating use cases, user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and other specifications.
<br><br>
<b>4.Requirements Validation:</b> Ensuring that the requirements are complete, accurate, and consistent. This includes reviewing the requirements with stakeholders, testing them, and validating them against business objectives and constraints.
<br><br>
<b>5.Requirements Management:</b> Managing changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle. This includes tracking changes, ensuring traceability, and maintaining the requirements baseline.
<br><br>
<b>6.Requirements Communication:</b> Communicating the requirements to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner. This includes creating documentation, presentations, and other communication materials to convey the requirements and their impact.
<br><br>
<b>7.Requirements Traceability:</b> Ensuring that the requirements are traceable from the original stakeholder requirements through to the final product. This includes linking requirements to design, development, and testing artifacts.
<br><br>
<b>8.Requirements Prioritization:</b> Prioritizing requirements based on business value, risk, and impact. This includes creating a requirements traceability matrix, identifying critical requirements, and managing requirements dependencies.
<br><br>
<b>9.Requirements Verification:</b> Verifying that the requirements have been implemented correctly. This includes testing the product against the requirements, reviewing the code, and verifying that the product meets the stakeholder requirements.
<br><br>
<b>10.Requirements Maintenance:</b> Maintaining the requirements throughout the product lifecycle. This includes updating the requirements as changes occur, ensuring that the requirements are still relevant, and ensuring that they meet the needs of the stakeholders.

<h2>User requirements</h2>
<b>1.Easy to use:</b> The system should be easy to use for both students and faculty, with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
<br><br>
<b>2.Availability:</b> The system should be available online and accessible from any device, allowing students to submit feedback anytime, anywhere.
<br><br>
<b>3.Anonymity:</b> The system should allow students to submit feedback anonymously, to encourage honest and open feedback.
<br><br>
<b>4.Flexibility:</b> The system should be flexible enough to allow for different types of feedback, including multiple choice, rating scales, and open-ended questions.
<br><br>
<b>5.Customization:</b> The system should allow for customization, allowing different departments or faculties to create their own feedback forms and questions.
<br><br>
<b>6.Notifications:</b> The system should send notifications to students and faculty when feedback is received, and provide real-time data analytics and reporting.
<br><br>
<b>7.Security:</b> The system should have strong security measures in place to protect student data and maintain the confidentiality of the feedback.
<br><br>
<b>8.Integration:</b> The system should integrate with other university systems, such as the Learning Management System (LMS), to provide a seamless user experience.
<br><br>
<b>9.Accessibility:</b> The system should be accessible to students with disabilities, and comply with accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
<br><br>
<b>10.Data Analysis:</b> The system should provide powerful data analysis tools that allow faculty to identify trends and areas for improvement, and track progress over time.
<br><br>
These user requirements should provide a good foundation for developing a Student Feedback System in university that meets the needs of both students and faculty.

<h2>System requirements</h2>
<b>1.Database management:</b> The system should have a secure database to store student feedback and related information.
<br><br>
<b>2.Authentication and Authorization:</b> The system should provide secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for students and faculty to access the system.
<br><br>
<b>3.Scalability:</b> The system should be scalable to handle large amounts of data and support multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.
<br><br>
<b>4.Usability:</b> The system should be user-friendly and easy to use, with an intuitive interface that can be easily navigated.
<br><br>
<b>5.Customizability:</b> The system should be customizable to allow for different types of feedback forms, questions, and other configurations.
<br><br>
<b>6.Reporting:</b> The system should provide robust reporting capabilities, including the ability to generate custom reports and track progress over time.
<br><br>
<b>7.Integration:</b> The system should integrate with other university systems such as the Learning Management System (LMS), Student Information System (SIS), and faculty portals.
<br><br>
<b>8.Security:</b> The system should have robust security measures in place to protect against data breaches and unauthorized access.
<br><br>
<b>9.Maintenance and Support:</b> The system should have a maintenance and support plan in place, with regular updates and bug fixes, and support for user issues and inquiries.
<b>10.Web-based platform:</b> The system should be accessible through a web-based platform that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.
