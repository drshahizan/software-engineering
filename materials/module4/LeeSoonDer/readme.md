# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Students'Feedback Management System

<h2>The stakeholders of a student feedback system for a university can include:</h2>

Students: They are the primary stakeholders in the feedback system, as they are the ones providing feedback on their learning experiences.

Faculty: They are also important stakeholders, as they receive feedback from students and use it to improve their teaching methods.

Administrators: They are responsible for implementing the feedback system and ensuring that it is effective and efficient.

Support staff: They may be responsible for collecting and analyzing feedback data, or providing technical support for the feedback system.

Parents: In some cases, parents may also be stakeholders, particularly if the feedback system includes questions about their involvement in their child's education.

<h2>Developing a student feedback system for a university requires careful planning and execution. Here are some steps to develop a student feedback system for a university:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define the <b>objectives and goals</b> of the feedback system: Before creating a student feedback system, it is important to identify what the feedback will be used for, what specific goals the system will serve, and what type of data will be collected.</li>

<li>Determine the <strong>scope</strong> of the feedback system: This includes identifying which groups of students will be surveyed, how often the feedback will be collected, and what topics the feedback will cover.</li>

<li>Choose the appropriate <strong>feedback method</strong>: Determine the best method for collecting feedback, such as paper-based surveys, online surveys, focus groups, or individual interviews.</li>

<li>Develop a <strong>feedback instrument</strong>: Create a questionnaire or survey instrument that asks relevant and appropriate questions that align with the objectives and goals of the feedback system. It should also be easy to understand and navigate.</li>

<li>Pilot test the <strong>feedback instrument</strong>: Test the feedback instrument with a small group of students before distributing it widely to ensure that it is effective, efficient, and that the data collected is relevant and meaningful.</li>

<li>Distribute and <strong>collect the feedback</strong>: Implement the feedback system by distributing the feedback instrument to the appropriate group of students, and collect the responses using the chosen method.</li>

<li>Analyze and <strong>interpret the data</strong>: Organize, analyze and interpret the feedback data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. The data should be presented in a way that is easy to understand, with actionable recommendations for improvement.</li>

<li>Disseminate the <strong>results</strong>: Share the results with stakeholders, including faculty, students, administrators, and support staff, to build trust and foster collaboration. This can be done through reports, presentations, or interactive feedback sessions.</li>

<li>Implement <strong>changes and improvements</strong>: Use the feedback data to inform changes and improvements to teaching methods, curriculum, and university policies.</li>

<li>Evaluate and <strong>update the feedback system</strong>: Periodically evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the feedback system to ensure that it continues to serve the objectives and goals of the university. Update the system as necessary to reflect changing needs and requirements.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Requirements Engineering Process for a Student Feedback System</h2>
<b>Elicitation:</b>
Identify key stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities.
Develop a list of questions to ask stakeholders to elicit requirements.
Select appropriate techniques for eliciting requirements, such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, or observations.
Document all requirements and ensure they are clear and unambiguous.
<br>
<b>Analysis:</b>
Review all requirements for consistency, completeness, accuracy, and feasibility.
Identify any conflicts or overlaps between requirements.
Prioritize requirements based on their importance to stakeholders.
Document all changes made during the analysis process.
<br>
<b>Specification:</b>
Use a standard format to specify all requirements, such as use cases or functional requirements.
Ensure that all requirements are testable and measurable.
Define any constraints or assumptions associated with each requirement.
Review all requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are complete and accurate.
<br>
<b>Validation:</b>
Develop prototypes or mockups to test requirements with stakeholders.
Conduct simulations to validate requirements and ensure they meet the needs of stakeholders.
Review feedback from stakeholders and make any necessary changes to the requirements.
Document all changes made during the validation process.
<br>
<b>Verification:</b>
Conduct a final review of all requirements to ensure they are complete and correct.
Verify that all requirements meet the objectives and goals of the feedback system.
Ensure that all requirements are traceable and can be linked back to stakeholder needs.
Document all changes made during the verification process.
<br>
<b>Management:</b>
Create a requirements management plan to track changes to requirements throughout the development process.
Use a requirements management tool to manage requirements and track dependencies between requirements.
Ensure that all changes to requirements are approved by stakeholders.
Prioritize requirements based on their importance to stakeholders and the project goals.
These requirements for the requirements engineering process are just a starting point and will likely vary depending on the specific needs and goals of each university. The requirements engineering process should be tailored to the needs of the feedback system, ensuring that all requirements are complete, accurate, and feasible
