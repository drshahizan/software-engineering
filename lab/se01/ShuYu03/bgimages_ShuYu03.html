        HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into
        visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
        and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of
        the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
        describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in
        the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were
        derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of
        generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print
        effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
