      The history of technical education in this country has been a century
      old. It all began in 1904 when a Technical School began its operation on
      Weld Road (now Jalan Raja Chulan) to teach Technical Assistants for the
      Federated Malay States Departments of Railways, Survey and Public Works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The school was officially known as Treacher Technical School, named
      after Sir William Treacher, the Resident General during that time.
      Students followed classed on part-time basis; they worked and trained
      specifically according to the technical needs of their employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Department In 1941, the Advisory Committee of Technical Schools and the
      Education recommended that the Technical School be elevated to a college
      status and proposed that a new Technical College be constructed. The new
      college was to be built on a 47-acre piece of Government land in Gurney
      Road (now Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Plans for the construction of
      the college, however, were put on hold when World War II erupted in
      Peninsular Malaysia.
