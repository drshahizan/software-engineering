# Lab 3: Format an article with HTML 

Please use appropriate HTML tags to standardize the [Lab3.html](./download/Lab3.html) file content presentation. By doing so, you can ensure that the webpage's formatting is consistent and complies with web development best practices. HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a webpage, and they make it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the information presented on the page.

For example, you might use heading tags like `<h1>` and `<h2>` to create a hierarchy of titles and subtitles, and use paragraph tags like `<p>` to structure the text content. Additionally, you might use lists tags like `<ul>` and `<ol>` to present information in a more organized and easy-to-read format.

Proper use of HTML tags can also improve the accessibility of the webpage, making it easier for people with disabilities to use. In summary, by formatting the Lab3.html file using appropriate HTML tags, you can improve its overall readability, accessibility, and compliance with web development standards.
