        <p>
            LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
            mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
            highlighters.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred
            by
            an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy
            that
            began at the agency's inception in 1947.
        </p>

        <p>
            CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars
            of
            several historic events, such as:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>the Cold War </li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade </li>
        </ol>
