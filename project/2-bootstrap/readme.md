## An Overview of the File and Contents of Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a popular front-end web development framework that is widely used to create responsive and mobile-first websites. It is a free and open-source framework that includes pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that help developers create websites quickly and easily.

Bootstrap web templates are pre-designed website layouts that are built using the Bootstrap framework. They provide a solid foundation for developers and designers to create responsive and mobile-friendly websites without having to start from scratch. Bootstrap templates come with pre-built components such as navigation menus, buttons, forms, modals, and much more, making it easy to create a professional-looking website.

Using a Bootstrap web template can save a lot of time and effort in website development, as it eliminates the need for designing and coding everything from scratch. It allows developers to focus on customizing the template to meet their specific needs, rather than starting from a blank canvas. There are many free and paid Bootstrap web templates available online, making it easy for developers to find a template that suits their project requirements.

Bootstrap consists of several files that work together to create a responsive and attractive website. The main files in Bootstrap are:

1. **HTML files**: These are the main files that contain the content of your website. They use the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files to create the layout and functionality of the website.

2. **CSS files**: These files contain the styles that are applied to the HTML elements on the website. Bootstrap includes several CSS files, including a main CSS file and additional files for specific components.

3. **JavaScript files**: These files provide interactivity and functionality to the website. Bootstrap includes several JavaScript files, including jQuery and Bootstrap-specific JavaScript files.

4. **Fonts**: Bootstrap includes several fonts that can be used on the website, including the popular font family "Helvetica Neue."

5. **Icons**: Bootstrap includes several icon sets, such as Glyphicons and Font Awesome, that can be used to add visual elements to the website.

6. **Images**: Bootstrap does not include any images by default, but you can add your own images to the website as needed.

## How to Create a Student Portfolio Showcase with Bootstrap Web Template: Step-by-Step Guide
The following are the steps to construct a Student Portfolio Showcase utilizing a Bootstrap web template:

1. **Plan your website**: Before you start coding, plan out the content and layout of your portfolio website. Decide what sections you want to include (e.g. about me, projects, contact), what information you want to display in each section, and how you want to arrange the content on the page.

2. **Set up your development environment**: To build your portfolio website, you'll need a code editor (such as VS Code) and a web browser. You can download and install Bootstrap or use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to include Bootstrap in your project.

3. **Create the HTML structure**: Start by creating the basic HTML structure of your portfolio website, including the header, main content, and footer sections. Use Bootstrap's pre-defined classes and components to create the layout and styling of each section.

4. **Choose a Bootstrap template**: Start by choosing a Bootstrap web template that is suitable for your project. You can find many free and paid Bootstrap templates online, such as on the Bootstrap official website or on marketplaces like ThemeForest. Look for a template that has a clean and modern design, and that includes features such as a portfolio section, contact form, and responsive layout. Some examples of templates that could work well for a student portfolio showcase project are "ResumeX" or "DevFolio" by ThemeWagon.

5. **Download the template**: Once you have chosen a template, download the template files and extract them to your computer. Make sure to read the documentation and instructions that come with the template to understand how to use it.

6. **Customize the template**: Open the template files in a code editor and customize them to fit your project requirements. Replace the demo content with your own content, such as your name, photo, bio, skills, education, and work experience. Add your own projects to the portfolio section, including descriptions, images, and links. Customize the color scheme, typography, and layout to match your personal branding.

7. **Add your own features**: Depending on your project requirements, you may need to add some additional features to the template. For example, you could add a section to showcase your achievements or awards, or include testimonials from your clients or colleagues. You could also integrate social media links, a blog section, or a resume download feature. Use Bootstrap's built-in components and plugins, or add your own custom HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code to implement these features.

8. **Test and deploy**: Once you have customized the template and added your own features, test your website thoroughly to ensure that it looks and functions correctly on different devices and browsers. Make sure to optimize your website for performance, security, and search engine optimization (SEO). When you are satisfied with your website, deploy it to a web server or a hosting service. You can use a free hosting service like GitHub Pages or Netlify, or a paid hosting service like Bluehost or HostGator.

By following these steps, you can create a professional-looking student portfolio showcase website using a Bootstrap web template. Remember to keep the website simple, clear, and easy to navigate, and to showcase your best work and achievements.

## File and Folder Structure 
1. Please include your contact information in the HTML `<head>`.

``` 
<!--html
Name:a
Matrix No:
Github id:

Project 2: Student Portfolio Showcase (Bootstrap)
-->
```
2. You must place your file in the submission folder. Within the [sec01](./sec01) or [sec02](./sec02) folder, create a folder called your `id github`. Name the default file as `index.html`. Suggested folder structure for this project:

```html
githud_id/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│   └── style.css
├── js/
│   ├── jquery.min.js
│   └── bootstrap.min.js
└── images/
    ├── profile-pic.jpg
    └── project-1.jpg
```

In this folder structure, the main `index.html` file is located in the root folder. The `CSS` files are located in the css folder, while the `JavaScript` files are located in the js folder. The `images` used in the project are stored in the images folder.

Note that this is just one possible folder structure and can be adjusted based on personal preferences or project requirements.
