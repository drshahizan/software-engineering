**Purpose**:
The Student Accommodation System project aims to develop a web application software system that streamlines and integrates student accommodations' management and application process at Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The system aims to provide a more efficient and convenient experience for UTM students and KTDI staff.

**Problem Statement**:
The existing accommodation application and management process at KTDI is time-consuming, prone to mistakes, and lacks integration. Students face difficulties in applying for accommodations and selecting suitable rooms and are frustrated with the long process of room action application, while staff struggle with manual room allocation and record-keeping.

**Significant Impact**:
1. Improved Student Satisfaction: Simplifying the application process and enabling room selection based on preferences enhances the student experience and satisfaction.
2. Enhanced Staff Efficiency: Automating room allocation and providing centralized access to data reduces administrative burdens and improves staff productivity.
3. Reduced Errors and Delays: Automated and streamlined communication minimize errors, eliminate delays, and improve efficiency.
4. Optimal Resource Allocation: Data analysis capabilities enable informed decision-making, optimizing the allocation of accommodations and resources.
5. Positive University Reputation: A well-functioning accommodation system demonstrates a commitment to student welfare and enhances the university's reputation, attracting more students.

## 2. Methodology

</div>

To develop the Student Accommodation System for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI), we have chosen the **Agile methodology** as our software development process model. The aim is to create a user-friendly and high-quality system within the allocated time and budget while meeting the requirements of our stakeholders.

1. **Agile Methodology**: We adopt the Agile methodology, which emphasizes cooperation and active stakeholder participation throughout the development process.
2. **Adaptability and Responsiveness**: The Agile approach suits the project's dynamic nature, enabling flexibility and continuous collaboration to accommodate changing requirements and priorities.
3. **Iterative Development**: We employ iterative development cycles, breaking the project into manageable increments to deliver value in each iteration.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The Agile process promotes continuous improvement, with regular feedback loops and opportunities for refinement and adjustment.
5. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Stakeholders are actively involved, providing input, feedback, and validation at different stages to ensure the system meets their evolving needs and expectations.

By utilizing the Agile methodology, we can effectively address the unique aspects of student accommodations, including the need for development flexibility and ongoing team collaboration. The Agile approach allows us to continually update and enhance the system based on stakeholder inputs, ensuring that the Student Accommodation System evolves to meet their changing needs and surpass their expectations.

</div>

### Testing Strategies/Techniques:
Our project has implemented the **black-box** testing strategy, specifically the Equivalence Partitioning (EP) and Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) techniques to provide complete test coverage.

1. **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)**:
Equivalence Partitioning is a technique used to divide the input data into groups or partitions that are expected to exhibit similar behavior. By selecting representative test cases from each partition, we can effectively test the system's response within that partition. For instance, Equivalence Partitioning is applied in our project as follows:

- Room Types: We can divide room types into partitions such as single rooms, double rooms, and shared rooms. Each partition represents a distinct behavior or characteristic, and we can create test cases to validate the system's handling of different room types.

- Payment Amounts: We can partition payment amounts into groups such as full payment, partial payment, and outstanding payments. This technique allows us to select representative test cases to verify the system's behavior for different payment scenarios.

By using Equivalence Partitioning, we can ensure that test cases cover different input partitions, increasing the likelihood of detecting defects within each partition.

2. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**:
Boundary Value Analysis is a technique used to test the system's behaviour at the boundaries of input ranges. It focuses on selecting test cases at or beyond boundaries to verify how the system handles these boundary values. In our project, Boundary Value Analysis is conducted as the next example:

- Maximum and Minimum Room Capacity: We can test the system's behaviour when assigning room maximum and minimum capacity. We can ensure that the system handles capacity constraints correctly by selecting test cases with values just below and above these boundaries.

By using Boundary Value Analysis, we can focus on critical values that are likely to cause issues and ensure that the system handles these boundary conditions accurately.

### Types of Testing:
Our team has used **unit testing** as an important part of our project's testing type. It involves testing individual units or components of the software to ensure they work correctly. The main goals of unit testing are to check that each unit behaves as expected and to detect bugs early in the development process.

During unit testing, we isolated each unit of code and verified its behaviour. This allows us to identify and fix issues in a focused manner. Then, we validated that units produce the correct outputs for given inputs and handle exceptional cases properly. Besides, unit testing also helps with refactoring and maintenance. It provides a safety net when making changes to the code, ensuring that modifications don't introduce new bugs and that the units still function correctly. Additionally, unit tests act as living documentation, providing insights into how the code is supposed to work.

Also, we could catch bugs early by performing unit testing, saving time and effort in the long run. It improves the overall quality of our code by making it more reliable and robust. Unit tests also aid in collaboration among team members, as they provide clear specifications for the expected behaviour of the code. Thus, unit testing helps us ensure that individual units of code work correctly, detect bugs early, support refactoring and maintenance, and improve the overall quality of our software.

</div>

### Quality Assurance Process:
To ensure the reliability and robustness of the software product, we have implemented the following quality assurance processes:

1. Requirement Analysis and Validation: Thoroughly analyze and validate requirements to ensure clarity and alignment with stakeholders' needs.
2. Test Planning and Strategy: Develop a comprehensive test plan that outlines testing objectives, scope, timelines, and resource allocation.
3. Test Case Development: Create well-defined test cases that cover various scenarios, including positive and negative test cases, boundary conditions, and edge cases.
4. Test Execution and Defect Management: Execute test cases and systematically track and manage defects using a defect tracking system or tool.
5. Regression Testing: Perform regression testing to ensure that new changes or bug fixes do not affect existing functionalities.
6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Engage end-users in testing to validate the software's usability, functionality, and user experience.
7. Compatibility Testing: Test the software across different platforms, browsers, and devices to ensure compatibility and consistent performance.
8. Usability Testing: Evaluate the software's ease of use, user interface, and overall user experience to ensure it meets user expectations.
10. Code Reviews and Quality Checks: Perform code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards, identify potential bugs, and improve code quality.
11. Documentation Review: Review and validate the accuracy and completeness of software documentation, including user manuals, installation guides, and release notes.
12. Continuous Integration and Deployment: Implement a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate testing, build, and deployment processes, ensuring frequent and reliable releases.

By implementing these quality assurance processes, we strive to deliver a reliable and robust student accommodation system that meets high quality, functionality, and user satisfaction standards.

One of the main challenges we faced was gathering and understanding the requirements of various stakeholders. This involved extensive communication and collaboration with students, administrators, and other relevant parties. By actively engaging with them and conducting thorough requirement gathering sessions, we were able to gain a comprehensive understanding of their expectations and incorporate them into the system design.

Looking ahead, there are several areas where the student accommodation system can be further improved. User feedback and continuous evaluation should be solicited to identify areas of improvement and enhance user experience. Implementing additional features, such as AI user chatbox integration or room application notifications, could enhance the system's functionality and convenience for users. It is also essential to prioritize ongoing maintenance and support to address any technical issues that may arise and ensure the system's long-term reliability.
