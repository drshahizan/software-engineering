<h1>Implementation Planning Draft<h1>

## Objectives
The objective of project implementation is to successfully execute and complete a project in accordance with the previously established objectives, scope, timeframe, and budget. The project plan will be put into practise, and resources, tasks, and activities will be coordinated and managed to get the desired results. 

#### The objectives of project implementation will include :

- Executing the project in a way that yields the expected outcomes or deliverables and achieves the planned objectives.
- Ensuring the project is completed within the boundaries of the defined scope, and controlling any changes or deviations from the scope through efficient change control procedures.
- Adhering to the schedule and timeline for the project, finishing tasks and activities within the allotted timeframes, and reaching project milestones.
- Efficiently allocating and managing project resources, including personnel, budget, tools, and materials.
- Engaging and communicating with project stakeholders, including clients such as student, medical officer and doctors by providing routine updates, resolving concerns or issues, and soliciting feedback to make sure the stakeholders' expectations and requirements are met.
- Identifying, evaluating and mitigating project risks throughout the implementation process.
- Ensuring that the deliverables and results of the project adhere to the specified quality standards.

## Task Breakdown
  
#### 1. Review the Acceptance Criteria:
- Refer back to the acceptance criteria defined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and ensure a clear understanding of the expected functionality and features.
- Identify any additional requirements or changes that may have emerged during the acceptance testing phase and incorporate them into implementation plan.
- If identified any additional requirements or changes during acceptance testing phase, discuss with stakeholder and modified the system based on the requirement.

#### 2. Prioritize and Break Down Tasks:
- Prioritize the implementation tasks based on their importance and impact on the overall functionality and user experience of the Student Health and Wellness System.
- Break down the tasks into smaller, manageable units. Consider using agile methodologies such as Scrum to organize and track the progress of individual tasks.
- Continuously update progress in Github for each members to ensure continuously improvement culture exist in the implementation of this project.
- Daily Scrum required to make sure every members understand the progress and know what to do next.

#### 3. Identify Development Approach:
- Select an appropriate development approach for implementation of project, such as waterfall, agile, or a hybrid approach. It is highly recommended to use agile method since it is more proper method to use in this project. 
- Consider the benefits and limitations of each approach to this project and align it with the project's requirements, team capabilities, and timeline.

#### 4. Agile Development Iterations:
- If adopting an agile approach, divide the implementation into iterations or sprints.
- Plan the scope of each iteration, ensuring that it aligns with the acceptance criteria and project timeline.
- Conduct regular meetings with the development team to review progress, address challenges, and gather feedback.

#### 5. Test-Driven Development (TDD):
- Implement a test-driven development approach, where tests are written before the corresponding code.
- Create unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests to ensure that the implemented features meet the defined acceptance criteria.
- Continuously run tests to validate the correctness and functionality of the developed code.

#### 6. Version Control and Collaboration:
- Utilize a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage source code and facilitate collaboration among team members.
- Establish coding conventions and standards to maintain code consistency and readability.
- Encourage frequent code reviews and pair programming to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing within the team.

#### 7. Continuous Integration and Deployment:
- Implement a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.
- Integrate tools such as Jenkins or GitLab CI to automatically build and test the application, ensuring that each code change does not introduce regressions.

#### 8. Regular Quality Assurance:
- Conduct regular quality assurance activities throughout the implementation phase.
- Perform functional testing, usability testing, and compatibility testing to ensure that the application meets the expected standards and user requirements.

#### 9. Communication and Stakeholder Engagement:
- Maintain regular communication with stakeholders, including PKU admin, KTDI MPP and PKU Doctor to gather feedback, address concerns, and keep them updated on the project's progress.
- Schedule regular demos or presentations to showcase the implemented features and gather feedback for further improvements.
