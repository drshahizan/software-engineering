## Project Objective: 
1. Simplifying the room rental procedure by making it easy for students to find available rooms, view details about the rooms, and complete the rental process without any trouble. The system should provide clear information about the rental terms and conditions, as well as any fees associated with the rental.

2. Enhancing security by maintaining the security of user information and ensuring that the payment procedure is carried out safely.

3. Streamlining administrative tasks by helping automate administrative processes like handling rental agreements, accepting payments, and producing reports.

4. Improve user experience by providing a better user experience by offering features such as room choices, and user feedback. The system will ensure that any issues or concerns can be addressed in a timely manner.

## Resource Requirements:

1. Development Team: The project will require a skilled development team consisting of software engineers, web developers, database administrators, and UI/UX 
   designers. The team should have experience in web application development, database management, and user interface design.

2. Hardware: Sufficient hardware resources will be needed to support the development and deployment of the web-based system. This includes servers or cloud 
   infrastructure to host the application, storage devices for data management, and network infrastructure for seamless communication.

3. Software: The development team will require appropriate software tools and technologies to build and deploy the room rental system. This may include programming 
   languages (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend languages like PHP), web development frameworks, database management systems (e.g., MySQL), and version control systems for collaborative development.

4. User Feedback and Testing: Conducting user testing and gathering feedback from college staff and students is essential for improving the system. This may require 
   arranging user testing sessions, collecting feedback through surveys or interviews, and allocating resources to analyze and incorporate user suggestions.

5. Documentation and Training: Resources will be needed to document the system requirements, design, and user manuals. Additionally, training sessions for college 
   staff and students will be necessary to ensure they can effectively utilize the system. This may include preparing training materials and allocating trainers or 
   experts to conduct the training sessions.

6. Time and Budget: Sufficient time and budget allocation will be crucial to ensure the successful completion of the project. This includes defining the project 
   milestones, estimating development and testing efforts, and monitoring progress to meet the targeted timeline and budget.

By allocating the necessary resources, both in terms of human resources, hardware, software tools, user feedback, documentation, and training, the KTDI College room rental system project can be effectively executed, ensuring the development of a robust and user-friendly web-based system.
